Objective: 
	To demonstrate the feasibility of replacing legacy Oracle Identity Manager (OIM 9i) workflows with Oracle APEX 19.2.

Problem Statement: 
	OIM 9i and its supporting components are end-of-life and no longer meet modern standards. The platform is unsupportable and poses significant operational risk. Additionally, a direct lift-and-shift to modern infrastructure is not feasible due to architectural limitations.
	 
Solution Overview:
	To address these challenges, I designed and built a Proof of Concept (POC) that replaces OIM 9i with a custom solution implemented in Oracle APEX 19.2 on Oracle 19c. The POC demonstrates that a modern, maintainable governance platform can replicate the essential features of OIM 9i while reducing risk and improving operational efficiency.

  Core features demonstrated in the POC
	• User creation
	• Responsibility provisioning (role/privilege assignment)
	• Password synchronization across Active Directory, APEX, and Oracle
    • Audit Readiness
   
Outcome Overview:
	The POC validates the feasibility of migrating from OIM 9i to a scalable APEX-based identity and governance solution. The modern stack provides easier maintainability, simplified upgrades, and improved supportability, while ensuring all critical governance functions are preserved.
